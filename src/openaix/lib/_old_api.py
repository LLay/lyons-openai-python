You tried to access openaix.{symbol}, but this is no longer supported in openaix>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openaix/openaix-python for the API.

You can run `openaix migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openaix==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openaix/openaix-python/discussions/742
